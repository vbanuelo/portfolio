      <!--- Think about what you really want your biography to say -->
      Victoria was born in Mexico but grew up in a small town in eastern New
      Mexico. She grew up on a ranch as part of a large family. She has had ties
      to NMSU since then with her father working for the Ag Science Center
      located in town. </br></br>
      
      She graduated with her Bachelors of Arts in Foreign Language and Bachelors
      of Science in Mathematics in 2008. She has worked in various areas of NMSU
      since then. She achieved her Master's degree in Educational Administration
      in 2017. She is currently working on her PhD. in Educational
      Administration. </br></br>
      
      Victoria has worked in many student-focused positions
      since she first came to NMSU and strives to support students. Other than
      her Associate Director duties, she is the Program Coordinator for the
      Osteopathic Medicine Pathway Program, academic advisor for Physical
      Sciences and Engineering majors, Chapter Advisor for the National Society
      of Collegiate Scholars, and continuing learner at NMSU. </br></br>
      
      P.S. She loves
      cows. Victoria was the Fall 2023 "A" Mountain Award winner which was
