      Victoria was born in Mexico but grew up in a small town in eastern New

      since then. She achieved her Master's degree in Educational Administration
      in 2017. She is currently working on her PhD. in Educational
      Administration. </br></br>
      
      Victoria has worked in many student-focused positions
